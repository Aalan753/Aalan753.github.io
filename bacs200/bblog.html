					<h2>Social Implications</h2>
					<p>&nbsp;When it comes to cryptocurrency, only about 25% of my friends actually know what cryptocurrency actually is. According to Forbes, they define cryptocurrency as, “medium of exchange that is digital, encrypted and decentralized”. With my experience, I have seen confusion among people on what it is exactly. They want to invest in it because of what they want but they don’t understand it. I believe that this confusion will cause problems among us since they don't understand the risk. Crypto is a currency that when invested in can be very profitable but it can also be quite risky. People don’t seem to understand this risk. So while the profits can can good, they need to understand the risk. </p>
