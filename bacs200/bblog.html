					<h2>Social Implications</h2>
					<p>&nbsp;When it comes to cryptocurrency, only about 25% of my friends actually know what cryptocurrency actually is. According to Forbes, they define cryptocurrency as, “medium of exchange that is digital, encrypted and decentralized”. With my experience, I have seen confusion among people on what it is exactly. They want to invest in it because of what they want but they don’t understand it. I believe that this confusion will cause problems among us since they don't understand the risk. Crypto is a currency that when invested in can be very profitable but it can also be quite risky. People don’t seem to understand this risk. So while the profits can good, they need to understand the risk. </p>

					<h2>Economical Implications</h2>
					<p>With this, it can also cause problems within our economy. When people invest in something like crypto, it’s value is what we give it. If we decide that it’s worth $1,000,000 each coin then that can become it’s value. Crypto doesn’t have the same regulations as stocks or mutual funds so it can vary. Having people invest in something like this and having it fail can have devastating results for our economy. When it tanks and people lose their money, it will have devastating results in crypto as people could start to deem it as untrustworthy. If it succeeds, we can start using a currency that doesn’t depend on one centralized government. It can give us more options on how we do business internationally and even locally. Investors can also gain profit when they buy and sell crypto. So it has it’s pros and cons.</p>

					<h2>Political Implications</h2>
					<p>&lt;As of now, there are little regulations on Crypto compared to stocks and bonds. If the government sees that there are ways they can profit from it or regulate it then they will try to get involved. One of the reasons why using crypto can be popular is because we can use it without having much trace of usage. If people start to hear that the government is getting involved then it can push them away from using it. If the government starts to regulate it, it can also bring in more people to ask if it's less risky and can seem attractive to more investors to the various types of crypto.</p>

					<h2>Conclusion</h2>
					<p>&lt;As you can see, cyrpto has it's pros and cones but one day it can grow to be as something that we use in our daily lives.</p>
