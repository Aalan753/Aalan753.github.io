    <p>The internet is a great venue for humor.  This page contains some funny things that might make you laugh.</p>
   

    <h2>Pinterest</h2>

    <h2>New York Times</h2>
    <p>Thanks to the power of the internet, we have access to old comic strips that were published by The New York Times</p>

    <h2>Videos?</h2>
    <p> So an app that I use quite often for funny videos is TikTok but I dont think they have an online website so heres a close competitor.</p>
