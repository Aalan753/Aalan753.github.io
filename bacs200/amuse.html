    <h1>Amusing Page</h1>
    <p>By Alan Canales</p>

    <p>The internet is a great venue for humor.  This page contains some funny things that might make you laugh.</p>
   

    <h2>Pintrest</h2>
    <p>So when looking for various funny pages, Pinterest in one that popped up. I've known them as a page to look for inspiration but they also have some amusing stuff.</p>

    <h2>&lt;Sometimes&gt; Fresh Laughs</h2>
    <p>Reddit is a great place to find fresh new laughs.  The Jokes subreddit has a mix of old and new jokes to keep things funny.  However, I can't always vouche for how clean the jokes are...</p>

    <h2>Old Laughs</h2>
    <p>Sadly, there's no guarantee a particular page or even an entire website will be around forever.  Case in point: <a href="http://www.chucknorrisfacts.com">http://www.chucknorrisfacts.com</a>.  I have fond memories of this site listing out some of the best Chuck Norris facts, some of which have lived their way on to infamy.  Fortunately, the <a href="https://web.archive.org/">Way Back Machine</a> website is constantly "crawling" websites and backing them up for posterity.  Here's a copy of http://www.chuchnorrisfacts.com from 2015:</p>
