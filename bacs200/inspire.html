		<p>A hero is someone who we look up to. Someone whom we can inspire to become.</p>
		<p> I believe that Elon has helped pushed a new wave for tech innovation. From his start with Paypal and changing 
 		the way people can pay and send money to sending people to space with SpaceX. He has started so many companies to help change society. I inspire to be like him.</p>
